Element Portals - Feature Development Branch
===============

A [Minetest](http://minetest.net/) mod that adds teleport capabilities in the game trough the natural elements found in the world. Portals can have a custom name and you can select your destination. The mod is separated in submodules so you can chose to use a subset of these portals.

Implementing on this branch
---------------------------

Bufixes for existing portals : 

 - Portal name is generated with duplicates [fixed]
 - Portal data is not syncronized with the node when burned or pulverized by tnt [fixed]
 - Portal list from portal form contained and empty item [fixed]
 - Overhead in register_abm for liquid portals [fixed]
 - Double consumption on teleport [fixed]
 - Various performance, complexity, DRY and cycle dependency fixes [ongoing]

New Features:

 - Sanitize portals - Checks for data and node pair, if they are not in sync then they are fixed - allows introducing new featres without needing to clear world alteration made by previous implementation [implemented]
 - Allow portals to be powered with surounding elements [implemented]
 - Tree portals [Implemented]
 - Sand portals [Implemented]
 - Quick sand needed for sand portals [Implemneted] 
 - Item portals functions [Implemented] - allows to implement tools or items that act as IN portals
 - Portal filtering by their direction types (IN_OUT, IN, OUT) and groups [Implemented]
 - Other utility methods that will help for the future portal nodes [Implemented]
 - '/teleport_free' command [Implemented]

Current portals
---------------

 * __Water portal__ uses water as connection and power, they are private and you can select your end point
 * __Lava portal__ act like water portals but use lava as connection and power
 * __Tree portal__ as home portal, the portal grows roots that can be harvested, when you need to get back home just plant the root and a link will be created to all of your tree portals where you can teleport. The planted root will slowly grow into a tree sapling after a while
 * __Sand portal__ used as fast escapes - just step on it and your on the other end

Under development
-------------------------


 * __Tree portal__ <strike> as home portal, the portal grows a tree from which you can take branches and use later to get back home</strike>
 * __Dirt portals__ for short distance public use
