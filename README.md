Element Portals
===============

A [Minetest](http://minetest.net/) mod that adds teleport capabilities in the game trough the natural elements found in the world. Portals can have a custom name and you can select your destination. The mod is separated in submodules so you can chose to use a subset of these portals.

Current portals
---------------

 * __Water portal__ uses water as connection and power, they are private and you can select your end point
 * __Lava portal__ act like water portals but use lava as connection and power
 * __Tree portal__ as home portal, the portal grows roots that can be harvested, when you need to get back home just plant the root and a link will be created to all of your tree portals where you can teleport. The planted root will slowly grow into a tree sapling after a while
 * __Sand portal__ used as fast escapes - just step on it and your on the other end

Under development
-------------------------


 * __Tree portal__ <strike> as home portal, the portal grows a tree from which you can take branches and use later to get back home</strike>
 * __Dirt portals__ for short distance public use
